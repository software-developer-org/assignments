# Preparations

Like in the previous challenge: read, learn and practice on the [git ready - branches](https://github.com/software-developer-org/git-started/blob/master/01_basics/0400_git-branch.md).

You may have realize that git and GitHub by default has at least one branch. By default it is called 'master'.

There are many other naming conventions and workflows. Read this chapter about [distributed workflows](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Distributed-Git-Distributed-Workflows) from the Pro Git book.

Using git and remote repos like GitHub branches and workflows are closely related to each other in that you define in your workflow on which branch you work. Like in this bootcamp, you have learned to always work on feature branches.

The most known and adopted workflow is called Gitflow.

# Exercise: branches

In the git ready exercise it summarizes Gitflow in short. Read more about it in detail [here](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/). Search on the web about Gitflow for better understanding.

Create on file for the git ready exercise and another file 'gitflow_summary.md'. Summarize in detail about your findings on Gitflow.

The git ready exercise references to [Branches in a Nutshell](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell#_git_branches_overview) from the Pro Git book. For a detailed understanding go and read it. Include the examples there also as a part of this exercise (and file).
