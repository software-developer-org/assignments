# Preparations

Like in the previous challenge: read, learn and practice on the [git ready - tagging](https://github.com/software-developer-org/git-started/blob/master/01_basics/0220_git-tag.md).

# Exercise: tagging

In this and all the remaining git exercises you can work directly on the sandbox. You don't need to create a local git repo for practicing beforehand.

Since this is a simple exercise you will study more about tagging. For this read:
- [Tagging](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging)

In the markdown file for this exercise it should contain the learnings from git ready and as an extra what you have read above. The extras should cover:

- sharing tags
- deleting local and remote tags
- checking out a tag

Please remember that you are working on the sandbox and on your own branch. So the tags should be created on your sandbox' branch!
