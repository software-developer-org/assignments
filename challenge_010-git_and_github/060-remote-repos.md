# Preparations

Like in the previous challenge: read, learn and practice on the [git ready - remote repos](https://github.com/software-developer-org/git-started/blob/master/01_basics/0300_remote_repos.md).

# Exercise: remote repos

What you learn here, is what you will use during your daily business. This is an important exercise! Try, practice, and play around as long as needed for becoming a git master.

Please remember that you are working on your sandbox and on your feature branch. So you need to 'map' (respectively convert) the git ready exercises using the git ready repo and replace it with the sandbox repo. In other words: use sandbox instead of git ready repo.

This exercise also assumes you have finished the previous challenge containing a feature branch with one or more tags! In this exercise you can create a new branch based on the previous one.
