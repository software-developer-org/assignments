# Preparations

Like in the previous challenge: read, learn and practice on the [git ready - commit, undo, amend, and reset](https://github.com/software-developer-org/git-started/blob/master/01_basics/0210_commit-undo_update_amend_reset.md).

# Exercise: add, amend, remove, reset, checkout

In this and all the remaining git exercises you can work directly on the sandbox. You don't need to create a local git repo for practicing beforehand.

For the exercise follow the steps as described in the in the git ready repo. Consider:

- Try to play around and do more than just following the steps one-by-one.
- Make as many commits as you want.
- Don't forget to create a new issue and branch for this!
- Explain what you have learned.
- Google around check out the git manual.
- Add some links and other interesting references on [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com), [Stack Overflow - git](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/git), [Stack Overflow - GitHub](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/github), and others.
- Demonstrate other examples.
- Keep it short!

Note:
The instructions on git ready assumes/is based on:
- existing commits.
- on a main (=default) branch called 'master'.

Since you are working a your new branch you have to:
- prepare/create these commits on your own!
- work only on your feature branch - neither on master nor on develop branch!
