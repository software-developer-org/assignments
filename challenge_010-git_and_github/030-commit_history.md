# Preparations

Like in the previous challenge: read, learn and practice on the [git ready - commit history](https://github.com/software-developer-org/git-started/blob/master/01_basics/0200_commit_history.md).

Again: create a new local git repo, do not clone and use the sandbox repo!

# Exercise: logs and commits

In this exercise you will document in a new markdown file your work from your last challenge.

For this you need to open two bash consoles:
1. first bash switching to the previous branch of your last challenge
2. second bash switching to a new branch for this exercise

In the 2nd bash create a new file showing the bash commands and output from the 1st bash:
- show the last 3 logs
  - the first log shows the latest commit
  - the second log the previous commit
  - the third log shows the 3 commit
- log 3
  - explain/elaborate commit #3
  - show changes of commit #3
- log 2
  - explain
  - show changes
- log 1
  - explain
  - show changes

Then commit and push your file.

Finally review on GitHub:
- review your files and commits
- review your issue
- optionally let somebody review your changes
- close your issue
