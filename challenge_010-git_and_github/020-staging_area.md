# Getting a Git Pro

You will learn in this and the following chapters all the git commands you need to know in daily business. Nevertheless for becoming a real [pro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional) requires 2 things: practice and theory.

The latter requires studying the basics and fundamentals. It is good to practice, but it is also important to ask yourself:
- why is that so?
- what is the concept/idea behind it?
- are the other ways of doing this?
And most importantly: never be too shy, asking things you don't understand!

Along by doing these exercises, I recommend reading the [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/) book.

Another good reference is the site [gitready.com](http://gitready.com).

# Preparations

First learn the basics of staging area as explained on the [git started repo](https://github.com/software-developer-org/git-started/blob/master/01_basics/0100_staging_area.md).

Then read these:

- [git ready - the staging area](http://gitready.com/beginner/2009/01/18/the-staging-area.html)
- [Pro Git - Git Basics9](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository)

For this you will need to create a local git repostiory using [git init](https://github.com/software-developer-org/git-started#git-init---create-local-git-repo). Don't use the sandbox or any other GitHub repo! The sandbox are designated for the challenge exercises!
